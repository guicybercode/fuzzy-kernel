# Architecture Diagram Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the architecture diagram.

To add the actual diagram:
1. Create an architecture diagram showing the flow: Edge (Zig) → MQTT/TLS → EMQ X → Elixir Server → LiveView Dashboard
2. Save it as `architecture-diagram.png` in this directory
3. The README.md will automatically display it

Recommended tool: draw.io, Excalidraw, or Mermaid
