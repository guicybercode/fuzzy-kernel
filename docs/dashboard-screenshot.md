# Dashboard Screenshot Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the dashboard screenshot.

To add the actual screenshot:
1. Start the infrastructure: `docker-compose up -d`
2. Start the Phoenix server: `cd server && mix phx.server`
3. Navigate to http://localhost:4000
4. Take a screenshot showing the device dashboard with real-time telemetry
5. Save it as `dashboard-screenshot.png` in this directory
6. The README.md will automatically display it

The dashboard should show:
- List of connected devices
- Real-time sensor readings
- Device status indicators
- Anomaly detection alerts
